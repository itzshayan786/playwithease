<h1>Refund & Cancellation Policy</h1>

<p>At PlayWithEase, we deal in digital products such as game activation keys, subscriptions, and digital codes.</p>

<h3>No Cancellation</h3>
<p>Once an order is placed and the digital product is delivered, the order cannot be cancelled.</p>

<h3>No Refund</h3>
<p>Due to the nature of digital products, refunds are not applicable once the product has been delivered successfully.</p>

<h3>Exceptions</h3>
<p>A refund may be considered only if:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The product key is invalid or not working</li>
  <li>The product was not delivered</li>
